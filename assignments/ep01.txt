1. Emmet is a tool used to speed up our coding process by content assist.

2. The major difference between a Library and a Framework is Inversion of Control. 
While libraries can work on even a small part of our code, frameworks provide a full fledged structure and have more control over the design aspects for our app.

3. CDN stands for content delivery network. It is used to include code written by someone into our app.

4. React is called React because it updates parts of the app without needing to reload the whole page and 'reacts' to changes actively.

5. Cross origin in scripts is provided to fetch data from server from different domains.

6. React is the library to build the front end of our application while ReactDOM allows React to interact with the DOM.

7. react.dev -- for development purposes
   react.prod -- for production purposes

8. async in scripts ->  the script is fetched parallely with HTML parsing. And when the script is available, html parsing stops and script is executed first, then parsing resumes.
   defer -> script is fetched parallely with html parsing, but execution is done once parsing finishes.
