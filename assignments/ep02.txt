1. npm is a package manager consisting of thousands of libraries for us to use.

2. Parcel is a code bundler. It gives superpowers to the app! JK.. it bundles our code for production and comes with many benefits like HMR, Code splitting, Tree shaking etc..

3. .parcel-cache --> stores info about the project for producing faster builds.

4. npx is used to execute npm libraries.

5. dependencies that are strictly required for development purposes are dev dependencies. Normal dependencies are required in the production build too.

6. The method of removal of unused code (also known as dead code) is called tree shaking.

7. HMR allows to automatically reload the page without needing to refresh the page manually.

8. 5 superpowers of Parcel: 
    i. HMR
    ii. Local Server
    iii. Image Optimisation
    iii. Tree shaking
    iv. Minification
    v. Code splitting

9. .gitignore ignores all the files that are included inside it.
    Files that can be re-generated should be ignored as it will take up unnecessary space in our project.

10. package.json keeps a track of the current and future versions of packages/libraries. While package-lock.json keeps track of current installed version of the package.

11. To avoid build issues in production vs development.

12. node_modules contains the code for all the dependencies/transitive dependencies. It is not a good idea to push it to github as it is huge and takes up unnecessary space.

13. dist folder is the place for the dev/production ready build of the app.

14. Browserlists allows the app to target specific versions of browser.
